# Lung Perfusion Analysis
This project focuses on the segmentation and quantification of lung perfusion in planar images (Anterior and Posterior projections). The goal is to develop an application that accurately identifies and extracts the perfusion regions from lung scans and computes statistical metrics.
## Objectives
The objective is to implement a segmentation technique to extract lung perfusion regions. Processing both Anterior and Posterior projections, statistical features such as area, mean intensity, and standard deviation are computed.
## Workflow
1. Image binarization
2. Application of morphological operators
3. Extraction of connected components
4. Definition of lung sectors and mask creation
5. Feature extraction and statistical analysis

This project can be useful for medical imaging analysis, providing insights into lung function through perfusion studies.
